**This portfolio is actively being developed. More projects and documentation will be added soon.**

Welcome to my CAD Portfolio a curated showcase of my 3D design work, both solo and collaborative. Here youâ€™ll find parametric models, detailed renders, and documentation for each project.



**Software Used**
- Fusion 360: Primary 3D design,modeling, assembly, and rendering 

**Mechanical Components**
- Custom mechanical assemblies
- Brackets and mounting hardware


**Skills Demonstrated**
- 3D parametric modeling
- Assembly design and constraints
- Technical documentation
- Photorealistic rendering

**In progress**
- Leg linkages and joint assemblies
- Sensor and servo mounting structures
